# Getting started: run python

This class is entirely developed with the python programming language. Some python knowledge is requires, see [here](README.md) for some intro resources. You have two options:

### 1. Unimib virtual machine

Classes will be in computer labs and you're of course welcome to use those computers. You'll need to login with your @unimib credentials. We'll be using virtual machines. 

- First, sign up using this link:

https://libaas.unimib.it/PubLab/register/34ddf7f4010db47dfa35

The image is called "Astrostatistics"; no worries, it's ok. Sometimes is takes a few hours before the virtual machine becomes available, so I encourage you to sign up well in advance.  

- Once you signed up, open a browser (either in the lab or from home) and go to

https://libaas-lessons.si.unimib.it

You will have access you a desktop-like environment where you can work freely. 

- I think the virtual-machine images are erased once a year. So when this class is over make sure you save your work somewhere else, so you'll be able to access your codes in the future should you need hem. 


### 2. Your own python distribution
At some point in your research you'll need to run python code on your laptop. I guess most of you have done it already for earlier classes. It might take a bit of effort to set it up, but sooner is better than later.

- There are infinitely many resources online, so help yourself with a bit of googling.
- If have trouble installing python on your laptop, I'm happy to help as I can. I have done it before on both Mac and Linux and can debug your errors. I don't have personal experience with Windows but I was told that getting the Anaconda installer is now the easiest way.
- You probably know this already, but installing things in python is as easy as typing `pip install something`. If pip install doesn't work, something is wrong with your python distribution.
