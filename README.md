## Aims

Machine learning and data mining are quickly becoming essential techniques in the field of (astro)physics. Such powerful tools provide precious insights into the laws governing natural processes and shed light on the information contained in experimental datasets. This lab provides a quick introduction to such topics, equipping students with some essential background to apply their data-science knowledge to core physical problems.

## Lectures

1. **[Probability](lectures/L01_probability.ipynb)** Probability theory. Bayes theorem. Descriptive statistics (*E: Monty Hall*)
2. **[Sampling](lectures/L02_sampling.ipynb)** Bayesian vs frequentist statistics. From the pdf to the samples: inverse transform, acceptance/rejection (*E: Black holes*)
3. **[Density estimation](lectures/L03_densityestimation.ipynb)** From the samples to the pdf: histograms, Kernel Density Estimation. (*E: Exoplanets*)
4. **[Markow chains](lectures/L04_Markovchains.ipynb)** Monte Carlo integrations. Markow chains. (*E: Weather forecast, N-dimemsional balls*)
5. **[MCMC](lectures/L05_MCMC.ipynb)** Metropolis Hastings. MCMC diagnostics. Modern samplers. (*E: Time transients*)
6. **[Model selection](lectures/L06_modelselection.ipynb)** Bayesian model selection. Savage-Dickey density ratio. (*E: Higgs Boson*)
7. **[Nested sampling](lectures/L07_nestedsampling.ipynb)** Computing the evidence. Nested sampling. Modern samples. (*E: Time transients & Higgs Boson*)
8. **[Project](lectures/L08_project.ipynb)** (*E: The expansion of the Universe*)

## Resources

Here are some useful textbooks. The first one is easier, the second one is amazing, the third is short and sweet, the fourth and fifth ones are for the true Bayesians...

## Exams

Each lecture has an exercise at the end (actually, most of the time in class is dedicated to completing these problems!). At the end of the class, you will have to submit your codes showcasing what you've done on these problems. There will not be oral exams. The outcome will be provided as a passed / not passed statement (no numbers).

To submit your codes, register on github.com, create a new **private** repository called `machinelearning4physics_bicocca_2024_solutions`, upload your files, and share it with the two of us (usernames `dgerosa` and `gfumagalli`). See [here for detailed instructions](examsubmission.md).

Exams will be cleared according to the nominal calendar available on the student service website.
