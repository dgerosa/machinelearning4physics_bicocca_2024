# Laboratory of Machine Learning Applied to Physical Systems
**[Davide Gerosa](https://davidegerosa.com/)** (module lead) - davide.gerosa@unimib.it  
**Giulia Fumagalli** (teaching assistant) - g.fumagalli47@campus.unimib.it 

University of Milano-Bicocca, 2024.

## Aims

Machine learning and data mining are quickly becoming essential techniques in the field of (astro)physics. Such powerful tools provide precious insights into the laws governing natural processes and shed light on the information contained in experimental datasets. This lab provides a quick introduction to such topics, equipping students with some essential background to apply their data-science knowledge to core physical problems.
